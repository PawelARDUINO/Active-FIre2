This is the second release of the Active FIre plugin!  
It had been modified in order fix the problems earlier users experienced with the downloads of the fire data.
It also includes a counter for the number of fire pixels in the data.  

The plugin downloads Active Fire data from the past 24 hours from NASA's website where it is freely available, and displays it in the QGIS project.  
The website can be found here: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data

The user can choose between two kind of data:

-Data from MODIS C6 
-Data from VIIRS

Then the user can exit the plugin by pressing the 'Exit' button.

The plugin is designed to only allow the download of a dataset if there is no other layer with the same name in the project, in order not avoid too many layers being added by clicking mistake. The user can still download both data from MODIS C6 and VIIRS in the same project.  

This plugin was developed by Pawel Dzierzynski from The Map Workshop
